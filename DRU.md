<sup><sub>Disclaimer: Any similarity or resemblance of the project’s name to a certain cinematic universe is purely non-coincidental. 
  That said, I personally have no idea about what goes on in MCU. 
  I use this analogy to stress that research can be as fun as watching a MCU movie (assuming most people love the latter). 
  Working and fun may not be orthogonal.</sub></sup>
