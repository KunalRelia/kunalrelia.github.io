Currently, Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. Julia Stoyanovich. I came to the beautiful - and very busy - city of New York in January 2015 to pursue a M.S. degree. More information coming soon!!

### Research

To be honest, I just started working on the website. I'll update it soon!
